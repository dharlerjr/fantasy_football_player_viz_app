## Sample Insights

1. De'Von Achane scored 51.3 PPR points in week 3 against the Denver Broncos. However, despite this single-week performance leading all running backs, Achane only finished as the RB24.
2. Rookie wide receiver Tank Dell finished as the WR38. He had a high weekly median score of 17.2 PPR points. His low finish is largely due to the leg injury that he suffered in week 13, which caused him to miss the rest of the season.
3. Lamar Jackson and Brock Purdy both finished as QB1s. Purdy, however, proved to be the more efficient investment for fantasy managers during draft season, as Lamar costed a 3rd round pick, while Purdy largely went undrafted.

## Improvements

## More Notes

- The data I used was retrieved from FantasyPros.com. However, I'm sure plenty of resources exist online for retrieving fantasy football data.
- Team logos and wordmarks are courtesy of the nflfastR team. These logos and wordmarks are by far my favorite feature, and I'm glad I able to figure out how to render them on my app.
